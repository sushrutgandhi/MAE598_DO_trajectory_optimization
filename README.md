# MAE598_DO_trajectory_optimization
- Run p1_v6_2_5sec.m file for energy optimization using "fmincon-sqp", which contains function "power_SSS_v3_2_5sec.m".
- Function "power_SSS_v3_2_5sec.m" includes calculation of Forward kinematics,Dynamic modeling, Equation of motion of 5 DOF Manipulator.
- T_Ene_graph_2_5sec.m is used to calculate optimized power.
- Note :- Matlab Peter Cork toolbox is required for visualization of Manipulator motion for 2.5 seconds(peter_cork.m).
